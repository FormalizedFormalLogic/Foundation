# lean4-logic

This project is aim to formalize some various results of mathematical logic in [Lean Theorem Prover](https://lean-lang.org).

This book provides explanation and summaries of formalized concepts, theorems, propositions.
Proofs of them are not explained, refer to the code or the [references](./references.md).

Full documentation is [here](https://iehality.github.io/lean4-logic/docs).

## Main Results

### Classical Propositional Logic

- Soundness and completeness.

### First-Order Logic

The list of main formalized results in first-order (Predicate) logics.

- Cut-elimination of sequent calculus (_Gentzen's Hauptsatz_).
- Soundness and completeness.
- _Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem_.

### Superintuitionistic Propositional Logic

The list of main formalized results in superintuitionistic propositional logics.


- [Soundness](./superntuitionistic/kripke_soundness.md) and [completeness](./superntuitionistic/kripke_completeness.md) for Kripke semantics.
- [Law of Excluded Middle doesn't hold in intuitionistic logic.](./superntuitionistic/reject_lem.md)
- [Disjunctive property of intuitionistic logic.](./superntuitionistic/dp.md)

### Standard Modal Logic

The list of main formalized in standard modal logics.

- Definability of Kripke frame.
- [Soundness](./standard_modal/kripke_soundness.md) and [completeness](./standard_modal/kripke_completeness.md) for Kripke semantics.
