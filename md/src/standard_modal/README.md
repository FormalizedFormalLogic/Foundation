# Standard Modal Logic

As a general term for various modal logics commonly known as $\bf K$, $\bf S4$, etc., we refer to the logic defined on a language that includes the modal operators $\Box$ (Box) and $\Diamond$ (Diamond), where $\Diamond$ is defined as the dual of $\Box$ (i.e., $\Diamond \varphi \equiv \lnot\Box\lnot \varphi$), as *Standard Modal Logic*[^remark_standard_modal_logic].

> Be cautious similar notations for different concepts.
> We use $\TeX$ notation for concept that unrelated to our formalization, and code block \`\` for related our formalization.
> - $\sf K$ (`\sf K`) is axiom schema unrelated to formalization.
> - $\bf K$ (`\bf K`) is logic urelated to formalization.
> - `𝗞` (Mathematical Sans-Serif Bold) is `AxiomSet` in formalization.
> - `𝐊` (Mathematical Bold Capital) is `DeductionParameter` in formalization.

[^remark_standard_modal_logic]: This term is probably not usual. We introducing for convenience in naming and organizing within our formalization.
