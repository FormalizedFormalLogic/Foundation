# lean4-logic

This project is aim to formalize some various results of mathematical logic in [Lean Theorem Prover](https://lean-lang.org).

## Main Results

### Classical Propositional Logic

- Soundness and completeness.

### First-Order Logic

The list of main formalized results in first-order (Predicate) logics.

- Cut-elimination of sequent calculus (_Gentzen's Hauptsatz_).
- Soundness and completeness.
- _Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem_.

### Superintuitionistic Propositional Logic

The list of main formalized results in superintuitionistic propositional logics.

- Soundness and completeness for Kripke semantics.
- Law of Excluded Middle doesn't hold in intuitionistic logic.
- Disjunctive property of intuitionistic logic.

### Standard Modal Logic

The list of main formalized in standard modal logics.

- Definability of Kripke frame.
- Soundness and completeness for Kripke semantics.
- _Gödel-McKensey-Tarski Theorem_ and Modal companion.
