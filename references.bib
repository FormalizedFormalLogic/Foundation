               systematic introduction to the principal ideas and results

               on completeness and decidability. Illustrative chapters

               rapidly expanding branch of logic, and familiarity with the
               subject is now regarded as a necessary part of every
               philosopher's technical equipment. Chellas here offers an

              natural sublogics of IL are modally incomplete. Finally, we
              prove that these incomplete logics are complete with
              respect to generalized Veltman prestructures. As a

  abstract = {Abstract We study various properties of formalised
              relativised interpretability. In the central part of this
              thesis we study for different interpretability logics the
              following aspects: completeness for modal semantics,
              decidability and algorithmic complexity. In particular, we
              study two basic types of relational semantics for
              interpretability logics. One is the Veltman semantics,
              which we shall refer to as the regular or ordinary
              semantics; the other is called generalised Veltman
              semantics. In the recent years and especially during the
              writing of this thesis, generalised Veltman semantics was
              shown to be particularly well-suited as a relational
              semantics for interpretability logics. In particular, modal
              completeness results are easier to obtain in some cases;
              and decidability can be proven via filtration in all known
              cases. We prove various new and reprove some old
              completeness results with respect to the generalised
              semantics. We use the method of filtration to obtain the
              finite model property for various logics. Apart from
              results concerning semantics in its own right, we also
              apply methods from semantics to determine decidability
              (implied by the finite model property) and complexity of
              provability (and consistency) problems for certain
              interpretability logics. From the arithmetical standpoint,
              we explore three different series of interpretability
              principles. For two of them, for which arithmetical and
              modal soundness was already known, we give a new proof of
              arithmetical soundness. The third series results from our
              modal considerations. We prove it arithmetically sound and
              also characterise frame conditions w.r.t. ordinary Veltman
              semantics. We also prove results concerning the new series
              and generalised Veltman semantics. Abstract prepared by
